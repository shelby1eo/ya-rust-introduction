This config is based on the Starter config for NvChad v2 https://nvchad.com/.  
There are a couple changes compared to the original one.  
It is not polished and intended to be used as minimal config with support of rust to be used in the container.  
Please do not take this as example for your config on youtube there is better examples to inspire from.
